# photo-drag
simple photo dragging app. buggy, but it works

Bugs - 
Photo you are currently dragging doesn't necesarily take precedence (hovering over another
photo with higher z index will make mouse switch to dragging other photo.

Photo selector doesn't reset after a refresh

Works differently on Firefox and Chrome
